During the summer of 2020 I undertook a project to build my own remote controlled quadcopter. While researching the workings of quadcopters, I learned about IMUs and process of how a quadcopter levels itself. Deciding upon an IMU consisting of a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer, I purchased the necessary hardware to begin building. I chose an Arduino Uno to serve as the flight controller due to its ease of programming and its large current output compared to the Arduino mini.<br/>

*Mounted Arduino UNO*</center><br/>
I mounted the Arduino above the surface of the frame in order to place the IMU at the center of the quadcopter. That way the vibrations from the motors would have the smallest effect on the IMU. The mount for the Arduino and for the IMU were both designed by me  <br/>

*MPU-6050 Gyroscope/Accelerometer*</center><br/>
I chose the MPU-6050 gyro/accelerometer because it contained everything I needed for the IMU on one board and was 5V compatible.
