During the summer of 2020 I undertook a project to build my own remote controlled quadcopter. While researching the workings of quadcopters, I learned about IMUs and process of how a quadcopter levels itself. Deciding upon an IMU consisting of a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer, I purchased the necessary hardware to begin building. I chose an Arduino Uno to serve as the flight controller due to its ease of programming and its large current output compared to the Arduino mini.<br/>

I chose the MPU-6050 gyro/accelerometer because it contained everything I needed for the IMU on one board and was 5V compatible.
