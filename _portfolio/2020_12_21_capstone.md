My interdisciplinary capstone project during the fall 2020 semester involved automating and improving a lab prototype for manufacturing composite prepreg filament. The system took as inputs the raw materials of plastic pellets and carbon fiber, and produced a composite filament which could then be used in automated fiber placement and 3D printing.
