In the fall semester of 2020, I took a class in robotics that included a small group project as part of the course. My group decided to simulate a cable robot using MATLAB. The position of a cable robot is controlled by shortening and lengthening a series of cables attached to the robot on one end and a fixed base point on the other. We chose to control our simulated robot using inverse kinematics. Given a desired location, our MATLAB code calculated the required cable lengths to achieve this position.<br/>
